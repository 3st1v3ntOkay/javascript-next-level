# PRO of JavaScript 🫴🏻🔥

Here I will upload my progress with JavaScript to Pro.

## Instructions

To see what I'm doing, first clone this repository, and after installing the dependencies with your favorite package manager, I use Yarn, but I'm starting to like pnpm.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/3st1v3ntOkay/javascript-next-level.git
```

```bash
  pnpm install
```

```bash
  yarn install
```

```bash
  npm install
```
