# PRO of JavaScript 🫴🏻🔥

Here I will upload my progress with JavaScript to Pro.

## Instructions

To see what I'm doing, first clone this repository, and after installing the dependencies with your favorite package manager, I use Yarn, but I'm starting to like pnpm.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/3st1v3ntOkay/javascript-next-level.git
```

Just choose one:

```bash
  # set your package manager with corepack (a feature of node v^14.19.0)
  corepack enable

  corepack use pnpm@latest
  pnpm install
  # or
  corepack use yarn@latest
  # corepack use yarn@stable
  # corepack use yarn@berry
  # corepack use yarn@classic
  yarn install
```
